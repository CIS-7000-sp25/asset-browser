### Frontend Setup

The frontend for this project is built with [Astro](https://astro.build/), and you’ll need Node.js and npm to run it locally.

1. Install Node.js and npm

   If you don’t have Node installed, you can get it via the [Node.js official site](https://nodejs.org/en) or with Homebrew if you're on macOS:

   ```bash
   brew install node
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory `frontend` and install dependencies

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Run the development server

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

   This starts a local dev server — typically available at http://localhost:4321.

4. Important note: the frontend fetches asset data from the Django backend, which is being deployed from the repo at https://github.com/CIS-7000-sp25/backend.

### The End!

If you run into any issues during setup, please let us know. The more bugs we fix, systems we adjust to, and documentation we can add, the better. Thanks!
